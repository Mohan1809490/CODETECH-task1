Overview of the Password Strength Assessment Tool
The password strength assessment tool is designed to analyze and evaluate the strength of passwords entered by users. It considers various factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide feedback on the password's strength. Here's a detailed overview:

Key Features:
Length Analysis:

The tool checks the length of the password and assigns scores based on predefined criteria. Longer passwords generally receive higher scores as they are harder to crack.

Complexity Analysis:

The tool evaluates the complexity of the password by checking for the presence of different character types:

Uppercase letters (e.g., A-Z)

Lowercase letters (e.g., a-z)

Digits (e.g., 0-9)

Special characters (e.g., @, $, !, %, *, ?, &)

The use of a variety of character types increases the complexity and security of the password.

Uniqueness Analysis:

The tool checks for repetitive patterns within the password, such as characters repeated more than twice consecutively.

It also compares the password against a list of common passwords to ensure it is not easily guessable.

Scoring System:
The tool uses a scoring system to assess the strength of the password. The total score is based on the following criteria:

Length: Scores are added for passwords of at least 8 characters and even more for passwords of 12 characters or longer.

Complexity: Scores are added for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

Uniqueness: Scores are added if the password does not contain repetitive patterns and is not a common password.
